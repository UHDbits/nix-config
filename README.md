# nix-config
This is a personal NixOS configuration, made specifically for my HP ProBook 445 G9 at the moment.

The configuration has the following features:
    - GNOME for the desktop environment.
    - Visual Studio Code and GitKraken for development.
    - Firefox and Chromium for web browsing.
    - Secure boot support.
    - Ryzen-specific power management utilities to make battery life substantially longer.
    - TLP in order to make battery life longer.
